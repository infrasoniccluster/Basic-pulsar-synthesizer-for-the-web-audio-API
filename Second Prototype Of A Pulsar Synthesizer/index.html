<h1>Second Prototype Of A Basic Pulsar Synthesizer </h1>

<h2>NOTE: This Works Best In Firefox and Safari </h2>
<p1>
  This is another prototype of a pulsar synthesizer that uses a buffer which stores grain window shapes, such as<br>
  gaussian, triangle, sinc, Hamming or any other arbitrary shape. In this prototype the buffer is storing <br>
  a gaussian waveform which is modulating the value of a gain node that is also recieving a signal from a <br>
  sine wave oscillator node. This creates amplitude modulation that sounds very much like a typical pulsar <br>
  synthesizer. The buffer in this prototype is set to loop at a low play back rate of 0.1 so that each individual <br>
  pulsaret can be clearly heard, where as at a play back rate of 1 the pulsarets fuse together forming a continious <br>
  tone. 
  
  
  <br> 
  <br> 
  
  Click the "load sound" button first to load the waveshape and then click the "play sound" button.<br>
  You will then hear a sine tone at 440Hz and its amplitude being modulated by a looping buffer with a gaussian <br>
  grain window. <br>
  The sound you hear is very similar to the default setting of a pulsar synthesizer known as "Pulsaret" by <br>
  Alessandro Petrolati. Here is a link to a YouTube video where he demonstrates it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iACjcISX4z0">Pulsaret_quick_start_1.mov</a></href> <br>
  At about 0:09 it starts with a basic pulsar sound that is similar to the sound that is heard here in this page.
