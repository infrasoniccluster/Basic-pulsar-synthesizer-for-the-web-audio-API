# Basic-pulsar-synthesizer-for-the-web-audio-API
This is a repository for a basic pulsar synthesizer that will be constructed for the web audio API. 

#Introduction
Pulsar synthesis is a special type of granular synthesis that was designed by Curtis Roads and Alberto de Campo. It was first implemented in SuperCollider 2 in 2001 with the title "PulsarGenerator". It was made popular by Roads in his book Microsound (2001) and also in his article "Sound Composition With Pulsars" in 2001 of March's issues of the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society: http://clang.mat.ucsb.edu/articles_files/SoundCompwithPulsars.pdf

As of today it has not been updated and can only be obtained from Roads and will only work on a OS-9 Mac computer:

There have been a few redesigns in recent years as plugins for various digital audio software programs so that it can be controlable with a MIDI event editor or a keyboard. However there has never been a version designed for the web audio API.  


#Basic Pulsar Synthesis
As an achievable aim for this project I want to construct a basic pulsar synthesizer. I will describe in detail how a basic pulsar synthesizer works and what components it needs to be constructed.
